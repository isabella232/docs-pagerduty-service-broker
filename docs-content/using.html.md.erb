This topic describes how to use PagerDuty Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='using'></a> Create and Bind a Service Instance with the cf CLI

1. Log in to your deployment and target the org and space where you installed PagerDuty Service Broker for PCF.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    $ cf target -o YOUR-ORG -s YOUR-SPACE
    </pre>

1. List the marketplace services and locate the PagerDuty service shown as `p-pagerduty`.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    </pre>

1. Create an instance of the PagerDuty service, replacing `SERVICE-NAME` with your preferred service instance name.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service p-pagerduty standard SERVICE-NAME
    </pre>

1. Bind the PagerDuty service instance to an app, replacing `APP-NAME` with your app name and `SERVICE-NAME` with your service instance name.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-NAME
    </pre>

1. Restage the app for the service binding to take effect, replacing `APP-NAME` with your app name.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf restage APP-NAME
    </pre>

1. The `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable of your app now contains links to documentation to help you to connect the app to PagerDuty. The documentation is also available directly on the [PagerDuty website](https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/).
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf env APP-NAME
    </pre>

##<a id='team-provisioning'></a> Team Provisioning

When adding the PagerDuty service to your Pivotal app, it will automatically provision a PagerDuty team utilizing the Space Name and your Org Name of your Pivotal environment. Additionally, when adding your application to your Pivotal app, it will create a PagerDuty Escalation Policy and Service for that new team.

##<a id='user-provisioning'></a> User Provisioning

User Provisioning can be accomplished in two ways: 

* Using existing users already members of your Pivotal space 
* Manually entering users 

If the user does not have an existing account in PagerDuty and they are added during the Pivotal user provisioning process, the user will consume a PagerDuty license.
